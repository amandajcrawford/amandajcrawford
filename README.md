* 🌸 Python is my first programming language and love.
* 🌺 I've been reading a lot of books lately. I'm currently reading the [The Four Hour Work Week](https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357). Read along with me.
* 🧚 You can ask me anything about: Python, Pandas, Data Engineering, and Distributed Systems.
